Predictive Model of Electoral Results in Mexico

üìä Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for my Data Science Capstone project, ‚ÄúPredictive Model of Electoral Results in Mexico.‚Äù This project leverages data from PREP, INEGI, and INE to analyze and predict voting patterns in Mexico, specifically focusing on the 2024 elections where MORENA achieved a significant victory with a 59% acceptance rate.

üß† Key Objectives

	‚Ä¢	Voter Prediction Model: Develop a Machine Learning model to predict votes for MORENA based on various socioeconomic and demographic variables.
	‚Ä¢	Actionable Insights: Provide strategic recommendations for the opposition parties to improve their electoral results in the 2030 elections.

üìã Methodology

This project involved several stages, including:

	1.	Data Engineering: Acquisition, cleaning, and merging of datasets from multiple sources (PREP, INEGI, INE).
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis and visualization of electoral and socioeconomic data to uncover patterns and trends.
	3.	Feature Engineering: Creation of new features based on existing data to enhance model accuracy.
	4.	Clustering: Unsupervised learning techniques (k-Means Clustering) to identify key voter profiles.
	5.	Predictive Modeling: Development and evaluation of multiple Machine Learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.
	6.	Reporting: Compilation of findings and strategic recommendations.

üîë Key Insights

	‚Ä¢	Voter Profiles: Two distinct voter profiles were identified using clustering techniques, providing a clearer understanding of electoral bases.
	‚Ä¢	Predictive Accuracy: A final Lasso Regression model achieved 98% accuracy in predicting MORENA votes.
	‚Ä¢	Economic Analysis: The project revealed stagnation in GDP growth since 2018, underscoring the need for a stronger economic strategy from opposition parties.
	‚Ä¢	Campaign Strategy: The analysis suggests that the opposition should focus on direct engagement with impoverished populations, who are significant supporters of MORENA.

üìà Data Sources

	‚Ä¢	PREP: Data from the 2018 and 2024 Mexican elections.
	‚Ä¢	INEGI: Socioeconomic data, including variables such as GDP, poverty rates, and education levels.
	‚Ä¢	INE: Information on political party performance, campaign events, and budget allocations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

	‚Ä¢	Programming Language: Python
	‚Ä¢	Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
	‚Ä¢	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
